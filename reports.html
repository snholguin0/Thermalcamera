        <h3>Research Paper</h3>
        <p>
          This paper explains the full development of the Raspberry Pi thermal camera, including hardware setup, 
          sensor behavior, image processing, user interface design, and final project evaluation. It outlines challenges, 
          testing data, and how the system relates to real-world IoT applications.

          <p><strong>Week 1 – 11/01/25</strong><br>
            Intro to the project. Set up the Raspberry Pi, installed required libraries, and tested initial communication 
            with the AMG8833 thermal sensor. Verified basic pixel output and started planning interface layout.

          <p><strong>Week 2 – 11/08/25 – Circuits Week</strong><br>
            Completed wiring the thermal sensor, corrected voltage inconsistencies, and organized the breadboard layout.
            Began refining temperature conversion logic and tested blocky low-resolution frames from the sensor.

          <p><strong>Week 3 – 11/15/25</strong><br>
            Implemented image smoothing, color mapping, and early motion detection testing. Evaluated different UPS (upscale) 
            values and adjusted heat thresholds for clearer output. Identified issues with sensor refresh speed.

          <p><strong>Week 4 – 11/22/25</strong><br>
            Developed and tested multiple interaction “modes”: thermal view, heat pen drawing, and laser-grid zone detection. 
            Improved stability and created overlays for zone feedback. Began preparing for web integration.

          <p><strong>Week 5 – 12/06/25</strong><br>
            Integrated the live thermal feed into a Flask server, connected it to the website, and started optimizing 
            frame speed. Fixed issues with blur, alignment, and mode switching. Finalized code structure for demo day.
