        <h3>Research Paper</h3>
        <p>
          Explains the full development of the Raspberry Pi thermal camera: hardware setup, sensor behavior,
          image processing, user interface design, and evaluation. Includes challenges, testing data, and how
          the system connects to real-world IoT use cases.

          <p><strong>Week 1 – 11/01/25</strong><br>
            Introduced the project, set up the Raspberry Pi, installed libraries, and confirmed basic communication
            with the AMG8833 sensor. Verified raw pixel output and began planning the demo modes.

          <p><strong>Week 2 – 11/08/25 – Circuits Week</strong><br>
            Focused on wiring and circuits. Cleaned up the breadboard layout, checked voltage levels, and ensured
            stable readings from the sensor before moving on to visual output.

          <p><strong>Week 3 – 11/15/25</strong><br>
            Implemented image smoothing, basic color mapping, and early motion detection.
            Experimented with upscale values and temperature thresholds to make the thermal image easier to read.

          <p><strong>Week 4 – 11/22/25</strong><br>
            Built out the three modes: simple thermal view, heat pen, and laser grid.
            Tuned the logic for each mode and prepared screenshots for the website.

          <p><strong>Week 5 – 12/06/25</strong><br>
            Integrated the live thermal feed into a Flask server, connected it to the website, and tested
            everything together. Focused on performance, blur, and reliability for demo day.
